        <h1>Philip's Life and Future</h1>
  <p>
    Before I begin, I think it is important to begin with a little background. I hail from Charlotte, North Carolina and come from a family of five, in between two sisters. I am grateful to have grown up in a family that supports and loves me, which has helped me so much in getting to where I am today. Growing up, I fell in love with physical activity. I love to get outside, whether that means playing sports or some other type of outdoor activity, like hiking. In high school, I realized I was an extrovert and spent lots of time hanging out with my buddies, and making new friends. I fell in love with Washington and Lee when I visited, and chose to come because I felt the community and academic setting would allow me to thrive. Now, as I'm finally here after months of anticipation, I look toward the future as I consider where I want to go with my life.

    <figcaption> The Grand Tetons, pictured above, are a special place to me. I've visited the area several times in the past few years, and each time, the mountain range's beauty never fails to blow me away. I think it is the most beautiful on planet earth. I hope to work in Wyoming this summer, and in summers following, on a ranch. Working there is a tradition in my family, and I hope to be the next relative to carry it out. From the experience, I hope to have fun, but also learn valuable life skills that will carry me in my professional career after college. </figcaption>

    <p> Golf is a lifelong passion of mine. My grandfather, father, and uncle all adore the sport, so it was in my blood from the beginning. Playing golf is most certainly ingrained in the culture I grew up in. Embedded above is a video of the famed golfer Tiger Woods hitting a shot at the Masters tournament. I love this video and ones like it because it embodies greatness in the sport. I hope to continue my passion for golf in the future. I'm not sure exactly what role it will play in my future, but it definitely has a place. Whether it is just as a way to get outside and interact with my peers, or playing competitively, I will definitely be involved in the sport.</p>
    <p> I am perfectly comfortable admitting that I have no clue exactly what I want to do with my life at this point. I have thought about my future intensely, and at this point in my life, I cannot committ to anything yet. I have ideas, but as of my first semester of freshman year of college, none have emerged as the winner. I have many reasons why I do not know what I want to do with my life and why I think that is just fine, which I would like to share. The first reason why I am comfortable not knowing my future plans yet is because I have trust in my foundation. My life is centered around strong core values, namely hard work, community, and compassion. I believe that my continued committment to these important ideals will carry me far in whichever direction I choose to travel. Second, I have great trust in my surroundings and community. I am fortunate enough to go to a school like W&L, and come from a loving family with great friends. Having such great support systems in place will allow me spur into action whenever I decide where I want to go. Be wary, this indecisiveness is not laziness, but rather careful consideration of how I want to best spend my life. A third reason why I am happy not yet knowing where life will take me is because almost no one's life moves in a straight line. Many of the successful individuals I know have started in one direction, and then completely changed courses multiple times. The twists and turns are the blood of life and are where you learn the most. I hope that my life will be rich in experiences and relationships rather than material wealth, as that is what matters most to me. Because of that, I trust that on my death bed I will look back and not regret my life choices. Instead, I believe that my willingess to adapt to changing circumstances will carry me the furthest in life.
